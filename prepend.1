.SH BUGS
.PP
This program functions by truncating the file to zero length before
writing data to it.
Data loss is technically possible if the program is killed or
interrupted.
However, this is a small risk, probably equivalent to the chance of data
loss occurring when using a shell to redirect the output of a command to
a file.
