.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]prepend\f[], as the name suggests, prepends data to files.
Data is read from standard input until EOF and is then added to the
beginning of each \f[I]FILE\f[].
Standard output is unused unless \f[B]\-\-tee\f[] is specified.
Standard error is used only for error messages.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-tee
Prints the contents of \f[I]FILE\f[] to stdout after prepending data.
If more than one \f[I]FILE\f[] was specified, the new contents of each
\f[I]FILE\f[] is printed in the order in which the \f[I]FILE\f[]s were
listed

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Add the word "Groceries" (followed by a line break) to the start of
shopping.txt:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
prepend\ shopping.txt\ <<<\ "Groceries"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Prepend the contents of foo.txt to bar.txt:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
prepend\ bar.txt\ <\ foo.txt
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Check every .sh file in the current directory for a shebang, and prepend
\[aq]#!/usr/bin/env bash\[aq] to the file if none is found:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
for\ file\ in\ ./*.sh;\ do
\ \ \ \ if\ !\ grep\ \[aq]#!\[aq]\ "$file"\ &>\ /dev/null;\ then
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ prepend\ "$file"\ <<<\ \[aq]#!/usr/bin/env\ bash\[aq]
\ \ \ \ fi
done
\f[]
.fi
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
The error message that is most likely to be displayed during normal
usage is "Writing to file \f[I]FILE\f[] failed: CAUSE", with CAUSE being
something like "Permission denied" or "Is a directory".
These errors should be self\-explanatory.
.PP
Invalid usage will result in an error message detailing how the usage
was incorrect.
.PP
Other error messages may be displayed if I/O errors occur.

.SH BUGS
.SS Potential for Data Loss
.PP
Because \f[B]prepend\f[] functions by truncating the \f[I]FILE\f[](s) to
zero length before writing data, data loss is possible if
\f[B]prepend\f[] is killed or interrupted.
However, this is a small risk, equivalent to the chance of data loss
occurring when using a shell to redirect the output of a command to a
file.
